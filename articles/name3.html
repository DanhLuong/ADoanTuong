                <p class="overview">
                    In this post, we will see some general types of vulnerabilities faced in a SCADA
                    system that will help you properly deal with them.
                </p><br />
                <img src="../images/SCADA-System-Vulnerabilities-2048x1152.webp" alt="robot" width="100%">
                <p>
                    SCADA is a very important tool in industrial automation. It is the very first big step in
                    interfacing
                    data with other highly advanced networks like the cloud, IoT, ERP, and MES.

                    But, you know that such a large amount of data handling and network interfaces also bring some
                    vulnerabilities and threats to the system. You have to be extra careful when dealing with SCADA
                    systems.

                    The most common vulnerabilities of a Supervisory control and data acquisition system are mentioned
                    below.

                    1.Cyber Security
                    2.External Connections
                    3.Open Coding
                    4.Weak 21CFR Scripting
                    5.Legacy Software
                    6.Default Settings
                    7.DDoS attacks
                </p><br />
                <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the first and foremost main threat to a SCADA system. You must have seen many recent cases
                    where a SCADA system was hacked and data was leaked. This is very dangerous for a system because a
                    hacker can stop the entire system and if the system was very critical, then it could be
                    life-threatening too.
                </p><br />
                <p class="bold">Free Cyber Security Course: </p><a href="" class="current_red inline">Join course</a>
                <p>
                    Attacks can be raised from either the hardware or software. If the hardware PC used is not updated
                    by Windows frequently, then there are chances that it will miss key security updates. This can also
                    include network updates. It is the first step in hacking.

                    Software used for SCADA also comes in updated patches. If it is possible, timely communication must
                    be given to the client to update the patch. If it is costly, then it’s a thing of the client; but it
                    will be better to spend some extra penny instead of wasting your whole system.

                    If the designer has developed poor SCADA network settings, then it is his job to rectify them. Also,
                    with the help of external IT policies, a computer can be made secured. The programmer must properly
                    set data historians, OPC servers, SQL servers, and VPN services.
                </p><br />
                <h3>External Connections</h3>
                <p>
                    SCADA deals with many number of PLC’s. The very first step is that the SCADA must securely deal with
                    data with respect to <a href="" class="current_red">PLC</a>. It must be tried to avoid open access to SCADA
                    from PLC.

                    Communication driver settings (for PLC) in SCADA have security features to keep the network and data
                    transfer intact and strong.

                    Nowadays, modern PLCs have <a href="" class="current_red">cyber security</a> settings. This can help in the
                    proper and secure data
                    flow.
                </p><br />
                <h3>Open Coding</h3>
                <p>
                    If the SCADA scripts, screens, and other settings are open, then an external hacker can access the
                    data and try to modify it. So, always keep the SCADA backup password-protected.

                    Mostly, <a href="" class="current_red">SCADA software</a> does not have a single password, like PLC. You have
                    options to set different
                    passwords for different things.
                    So, password complexity is a must in maintaining good security; and it is a little bit more
                    cumbersome than PLC security. This will ensure that your codes are not open and they remain secure.
                </p><br />
                <h3>Weak 21CFR Scripting</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="" class="current_red">21CFR and GAMP5</a> are very important standards for SCADA in the food,
                    beverage, and pharmaceutical
                    industries. This helps in the accurate monitoring, tracking, and observation of data in SCADA.

                    If the scripting of this program is weak, then unwanted access to data will not be tracked and the
                    company will then not be able to identify who did the wrong action and how it was done.

                    So, if you are using 21CFR, make sure that its program developed is very strong so that there are
                    rare chances of bugs and it will run successfully.
                </p><br />
                <h3>Legacy Software</h3>
                <p>
                    There are a very large number of SCADA systems that run on legacy software. A legacy system is
                    outdated computing software/hardware that is still in use. The system still meets the needs it was
                    originally designed for but doesn’t allow for growth.

                    A legacy system’s older technology won’t allow it to interact with newer systems. There are many
                    reasons for this like costs, difficulties in migrating to new technology, etc.

                    Due to all this, there are chances of high-security concerns in these software (like user/system
                    authentication and data integrity checking features). This exposes the system to a wide range of
                    cyber-attacks.
                </p><br />
                <h3>Default Settings</h3>
                <p>
                    Many programmers just run the SCADA systems with the default settings provided by the manufacturer.
                    If they bypass the network and other critical settings, then it is very risky to run the system with
                    such settings. So, always look for the meaning of all the settings and if required, try to change
                    the necessary ones.
                </p><br />
                <h3>DDoS attacks</h3>
                <p>
                    A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic
                    of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding
                    infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic.

                    DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as sources of
                    attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT
                    devices. It could be very easy for hackers to locate these systems by using specific search engines
                    like Shodan. The popular search engine allows attackers to retrieve all the information that could
                    be used to find a potential target exposed online.

                    In this way, we understand some general vulnerabilities faced in a SCADA system.
